# dotfiles

A repo containing my dotfiles such as .vimrc, .bashrc, etc. also contains some common scripts I may use frequently, as well as lists of packages that I may want to install on any new computer.

## Roadmap
1. folder per thing (git, vim, bash)
2. list all files in each dir, make backups if they exist, copy into home dir
3. add something for apt packages too

## Todo list
1. prettify install.sh
2. skip things that have no diff
3. give option to skip 1 file
4. add ability to pass overrides in (with special care because that's dangerous)
