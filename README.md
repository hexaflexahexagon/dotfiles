# dotfiles

A repo containing my dotfiles such as .vimrc, .bashrc, etc. also contains some common scripts I may use frequently, as well as lists of packages that I may want to install on any new computer.

## Roadmap
1. folder per thing (git, vim, bash)
2. .etcrc in each folder, as well as a commonly-named script in each folder to exec
3. central script to run all common scripts
